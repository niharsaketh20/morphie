# Morphie: Text to 3D Object Generator

Morphie is an innovative tool that transforms text descriptions into 3D object files. With Morphie, you can bring your ideas to life in three dimensions, simply by describing them in words.

## How It Works

1. Input your text description
2. Morphie processes your text using advanced AI algorithms
3. A 3D object file (.obj) is generated based on your description
4. Download and use your 3D object in various applications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/morphie.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd morphie
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view Morphie in your browser.

## Usage

1. Enter your text description in the input field.
2. Click "Generate 3D Object".
3. Wait for the processing to complete.
4. Download your .obj file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
